# NEST_Competition_Tixget
UW CS NEST Competition 2016

The idea of our app came from an actual problem we had observed as students. There is a UW Ticket Exchange group on Facebook where students post they want to buy or sell physical tickets. They message each other and then negotiate a price, meeting location, and time. We wanted to take this process and turn it into an app. While this was our inspiration, we really wanted the app to be flexible and not just for UW. We considered launching it fully, but didn't really have the time to commit to a startup.

A lot of work went into this project. It was primarily done by 2 people, but at one point had 3 people working on it. The code here is what made up our live demo.

The design stage took months, and we generated a lot documents from data models, UI flow, API routes, and more. They aren't very formal, but the project got to be fairly big and we needed them to make sure our work was accomplishing the plans we had. They can all be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8aw93liGbtqdF9XamhQRHBsNHc?usp=sharing

The presentation can also be found in that folder. It was about 20 minutes given to a panel of CS and business professors and software engineers.
